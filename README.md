# ADL331 - Artificial Intelligence & Data Science Lab (S5)

A curated collection of core AI & Data Science lab experiments under KTU S5 curriculum.  
All programs are implemented in Python using popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.

## ðŸ”¬ Experiments Overview
- Data operations & visualization  
- Regression models (Linear, Logistic)  
- Classification algorithms (KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree)  
- Optimization (Hill Climbing)  
- Feature analysis (Correlation, Covariance, PCA)

## ðŸŽ¯ Course Outcomes (CO)
- CO1: Data handling & analysis with Python  
- CO2: Implement regression techniques  
- CO3: Supervised learning models  
- CO4: Optimization & deep learning intro  
- CO5: Feature selection & dimensionality reduction

> ðŸ“Œ Focused on practical implementation and real-world application of machine learning techniques.
